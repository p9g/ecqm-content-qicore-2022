  "rationale": "Pneumococcal disease is a common cause of illness and death in older adults and in persons with certain underlying conditions. The major clinical syndromes of pneumococcal disease include pneumonia, bacteremia and meningitis, with pneumonia being the most common (CDC 2015a). Pneumonia symptoms generally include fever, chills, pleuritic chest pain, cough with sputum, dyspnea, tachypnea, hypoxia tachycardia, malaise and weakness. There are an estimated 400,000 cases of pneumonia in the U.S. each year and a 5%–7% mortality rate, although it may be higher among older adults and adults in nursing homes (CDC 2015b; Janssens and Krause 2004).\n\nPneumococcal infections result in significant health care costs each year. Geriatric patients with pneumonia require hospitalization in nearly 90 percent of cases, and their average length of stay is twice that of younger adults (Janssens and Krause 2004). Pneumonia in the older adult population is associated with high acute-care costs and an overall impact on total direct medical costs and mortality during and after an acute episode (Thomas et al., 2012). Total medical costs for Medicare beneficiaries during and one year following a hospitalization for pneumonia were found to be $15,682 higher than matched beneficiaries without pneumonia (Thomas et al., 2012). It was estimated that in 2010, the total annual excess cost of hospital-treated pneumonia in the fee-for-service Medicare population was approximately $7 billion (Thomas et al., 2012).\n\nPneumococcal vaccines have been shown to be highly effective in preventing invasive pneumococcal disease. Studies show that at least one dose of pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine protects between 50-85 in 100 healthy adults against invasive pneumococcal disease (CDC 2019). When comparing costs, outcomes and quality adjusted life years, immunization with recommended pneumococcal vaccines was found to be more economically efficient than no vaccination, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $25,841 per quality-adjusted life year gained (Chen et al., 2014).",
  "clinicalRecommendationStatement": "Adults aged >=65 years who have not previously received PCV or whose previous vaccination history is unknown should receive 1 dose of PCV (either PCV20 or PCV15). Adults aged 19–64 years with certain underlying medical conditions or other risk factors who have not previously received PCV or whose previous vaccination history is unknown should receive 1 dose of PCV (either PCV20 or PCV15).\n \nDosing schedule for PCV15: When PCV15 is used, it should be followed by a dose of PPSV23. The recommended interval between administration of PCV15 and PPSV23 is >=1 year. A minimum interval of 8 weeks can be considered for adults with an immunocompromising condition, cochlear implant, or cerebrospinal fluid leak to minimize the risk for IPD caused by serotypes unique to PPSV23 in these vulnerable groups.\n \nAdults with previous PPSV23 only: Adults who have only received PPSV23 may receive a PCV (either PCV20 or PCV15) >=1 year after their last PPSV23 dose. When PCV15 is used in those with history of PPSV23 receipt, it need not be followed by another dose of PPSV23.\n \nAdults with previous PCV13: The incremental public health benefits of providing PCV15 or PCV20 to adults who have received PCV13 only or both PCV13 and PPSV23 have not been evaluated. These adults should complete the previously recommended PPSV23 series (Kobayashi et al., 2022).",
