Women (10.4%) were almost twice as likely as men (5.5%) to have had depression. The prevalence of depression among adults decreased as family income levels increased. About 80% of adults with depression reported at least some difficulty with work, home, or social activities because of their depression symptoms (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2018).\n\nDepression is a risk factor for development of chronic illnesses such as diabetes and coronary heart disease and adversely affects the course, complications and management of chronic medical illness. Both maladaptive health risk behaviors and psychobiological factors associated with depression may explain depression's negative effect on outcomes of chronic illness (Katon, W.J., 2011).\n\nAdolescents and Adults:\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention states that during 2009-2012 an estimated 7.6% of the U.S. population aged 12 and over had depression, including 3% of Americans with severe depressive symptoms. Almost 43% of persons with severe depressive symptoms reported serious difficulties in work, home and social activities, yet only 35% reported having contact with a mental health professional in the past year.\nDepression is associated with higher mortality rates in all age groups. People who are depressed are 30 times more likely to take their own lives than people who are not depressed and five times more likely to abuse drugs. Depression is the leading cause of medical disability for people aged 14 to 44. Depressed people lose 5.6 hours of productive work every week when they are depressed, fifty percent of which is due to absenteeism and short-term disability.\n\nAdolescents:\nIn 2014, an estimated 2.8 million adolescents age 12 to 17 in the United States had at least one major depressive episode (MDE) in the past year. This represented 11.4% of the U.S. population. The same survey found that only 41.2 percent of those who had an MDE received treatment in the past year. The 2013 Youth Risk Behavior Survey of students grades 9 to 12 indicated that during the past 12 months 39.1% (F) and 20.8% (M) indicated feeling sad or hopeless almost every day for at least 2 weeks, planned suicide attempt 16.9% (F) and 10.3% (M), with attempted suicide 10.6% (F) and 5.4% (M). Adolescent-onset depression is associated with chronic depression in adulthood. Many mental health conditions (anxiety, bipolar, depression, eating disorders, and substance abuse) are evident by age 14. The 12-month prevalence of MDEs increased from 8.7% in 2005 to 11.3% in 2014 in adolescents and from 8.8% to 9.6% in young adults (both P < .001). The increase was larger and statistically significant only in the age range of 12 to 20 years. The trends remained significant after adjustment for substance use disorders and sociodemographic factors. Mental health care contacts overall did not change over time; however, the use of specialty mental health providers increased in adolescents and young adults, and the use of prescription medications and inpatient hospitalizations increased in adolescents. In 2015, 9.7% of adolescents in MN who were screened for depression or other mental health conditions, screened positively.","clinicalRecommendationStatement":"Adults:\n\nRecommendations and algorithm notations supporting depression outcomes and duration of treatment according to Institute for Clinical Systems Improvement Health Care Guideline (Trangle et al., 2016):\n\nRecommendation: Clinicians should establish and maintain follow-up with patients. Appropriate, reliable follow-up is highly correlated with improved response and remission scores. It is also correlated with the improved safety and efficacy of medications and helps prevent relapse (Trangle et al., 2016).\n\nProactive follow-up contacts (in person, telephone) based on the collaborative care model have been shown to significantly lower depression severity (Unutzer et al., 2002). In the available clinical effectiveness trials conducted in real clinical practice settings, even the addition of a care manager leads to modest remission rates (Trivedi et al., 2006; Unutzer et al., 2002). Interventions are critical to educating the patient regarding the importance of preventing relapse, safety and efficacy of medications, and management of potential side effects. Establish and maintain initial follow-up contact intervals (office, phone, other) (Hunkeler et al., 2000; Simon et al., 2000).\n\nPHQ-9 as monitor and management tool. The PHQ-9 is an effective management tool, as well, and should be used routinely for subsequent visits to monitor treatment outcomes and severity. It can also help the clinician decide if/how to modify the treatment plan (Duffy et al., 2008; Lowe et al., 2004). Using a measurement-based approach to depression care, PHQ-9 results and side effect evaluation should be combined with treatment algorithms to drive patients toward remission. A five-point drop in PHQ-9 score is considered the minimal clinically significant difference (Trivedi, 2009).\n\nThe goals of treatment should be to achieve remission, reduce relapse and recurrence, and return to previous level of occupational and psychosocial function.\n\nIf using a PHQ-9 tool, remission translates to PHQ-9 score of less than 5 (Kroenke, 2001). Results from the STAR*D study showed that remission rates lowered with more treatment steps, but the overall cumulative rate was 67% (Rush et al., 2006).\n\nResponse and remission take time. In the STAR*D study, longer times than expected were needed to reach response or remission. In fact, one-third of those who ultimately responded did so after six weeks. Of those who achieved remission by Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (QIDS), 50% did so only at or after six weeks of treatment (Trivedi et al., 2006). If the primary care clinician is seeing some improvement, continue working with that patient to augment or increase dosage to reach remission. This can take up to three months.\n\nThis measure assesses achievement of remission, which is a desired outcome of effective depression treatment and monitoring.\n\nAdult Depression in Primary Care - Guideline Aims (Trangle et al., 2016): \n- Increase the percentage of patients with major depression or persistent depressive disorder who have improvement in outcomes from treatment for major depression or persistent depressive disorder.\n- Increase the percentage of patients with major depression or persistent depressive disorder who have follow-up to assess for outcomes from treatment.\n- Improve communication between the primary care physician and the mental health care clinician (if patient is co-managed).\n\nAdolescents:\n\nRecommendations supporting depression outcomes and duration of treatment according to American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry guideline (Birmaher et al., 2007): \n- Treatment of depressive disorders should always include an acute and continuation phase; some children may also require maintenance treatment. The main goal of the acute phase is to achieve response and ultimately full symptomatic remission (definitions below).\n- Each phase of treatment should include psychoeducation, supportive management, and family and school involvement.\n- Education, support, and case management appear to be sufficient treatment for the management of depressed children and adolescents with an uncomplicated or brief depression or with mild psychosocial impairment.\n- For children and adolescents who do not respond to supportive psychotherapy or who have more complicated depressions, a trial with specific types of psychotherapy and/or antidepressants is indicated.\n\n\nRecommendations supporting depression outcomes and duration of treatment according to Guidelines for Adolescent Depression in Primary Care (Zuckerbrot et al., 2018 (Part I), Zuckerbrot et al., 2018 (Part II)): \n- Mild depression: consider a period of active support and monitoring before starting other evidence-based treatment\n- Moderate or severe major clinical depression or complicating factors:\n  -- consultation with mental health specialist with agreed upon roles\n  -- evidence based treatment (CBT or IPT and/or antidepressant SSRI)\n- Monitor for adverse effects during antidepressant therapy\n  -- clinical worsening, suicidality, unusual changes in behavior\n- Systematic and regular tracking of goals and outcomes\n  -- improvement in functioning status and resolution of depressive symptoms\nRegardless of the length of treatment, all patients should be monitored on a monthly basis for 6 to 12 months after the full resolution of symptoms","improvementNotation":{"coding":[{"system":"http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/measure-improvement-notation","code":"increase"}]},"guidance":"When an index assessment is conducted with PHQ-9M, the follow-up assessment can use either a PHQ-9M or PHQ-9.\n\nThis eCQM is a patient-based measure.\n\nThis version of the eCQM uses QDM version 5.6.
